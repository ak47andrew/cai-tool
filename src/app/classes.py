"""
This module contains the OC class which represents a character in an online chat platform.

OC has the following attributes:
- character_id: An integer representing the unique ID of the character.
- messages: An integer representing the number of messages sent by the character.
- memories: An integer representing the number of memories associated with the character.
- name: A string representing the name of the character.
- description: A string representing the description of the character.
- author: A string representing the author who created the character.
- tags: A list of strings representing the tags associated with the character.

OC has the following methods:
- __str__(self) -> str: Returns a string representation of the character object.
- __eq__(self, __value) -> bool: Returns True if the character object is equal to the input value, 
False otherwise.
- to_dict(self) -> ocJson: Returns a dictionary representation of the character object.

from_dict(data: ocJson) -> OC: Creates an OC object from a dictionary representation.

ocJson is a type alias for dict[str, int | str | list[str]].
